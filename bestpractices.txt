Best Practices Used

1) The file names needed in application should be added in web.config file.Even
if there is need to change file name we can change it from one single location
that is web.config.

2) The controller code should be as clean as possible.It's job should be only passing data to the user.

3) All data manipulation logic should be performed in repository class.

4) Have made use of unity for purpose of dependency injection.So controller is no more responsible for creating instance of class which it's need.This job of instantiating
class is perform by third party tool named Unity.

5)  A repository acts like a middleman between the rest of the application and the data access logic. 
A repository isolates all the data access code from rest of the application.

6) Constructor of Repository class should be static so that only one time
it will get called.In construtor we can place logic of retrieving all data from datasource
and bind it to the buisness entity/domain object.

7) Repository pattern should have interface and class implementing that
interface.In our case if we have to retrieved data from sql database or from
XMl rather than static json file
.We need to create another class that implements
the same interface but this class connects to sql database.

8) Add error handler to send proper messages
